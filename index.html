<h2>Our Love Story</h2>
<div class="love-story-content">
    <p>In a quiet corner of our beloved school, where lessons are taught and futures are shaped, fate gently began writing a love story we never expected.</p>
    
    <p>We were simply colleagues then—Vanvan, a teacher with a heart for her students, and Sir Ed, the ever-dependable disbursing officer. Life was calm, and our hearts, though single, were gently leaning toward others. It wasn't love at first sight, nor a whirlwind romance—but something far more tender.</p>
    
    <p>It began with playful teasing from our coworkers, light-hearted and harmless. We laughed it off, never imagining that their teasing would sow the first seeds of something real. Then, one ordinary day, the universe gave us a nudge. Our principal requested a favor, and Ed offered his help. That simple gesture led to shared moments, warm conversations, and a quiet realization perhaps we were never just crossing paths—we were being led to one another.</p>
    
    <p>What started as a coincidence became a connection. We didn't fall in love because of the teasing, but because we chose to see each other genuinely. A choice made not out of pressure or chance, but out of understanding, shared smiles, and the comforting feeling of being in the right place, at the right time, with the right person.</p>
    
    <p>And now, we choose each other every day for better for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish always.</p>
